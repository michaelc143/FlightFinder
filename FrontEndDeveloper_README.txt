Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Frontend.java - This class basically runs the entire program, loads the backend
and then handles the user inputs. I made sure to handle input validation and structure
everything to reduce rewriting code.
Flight.java - I made a wrapper to represent a path between airports
and gave it a flight name. This way rather than the app just returning a list of
cities, it will also return a flight name.

Additional Contributions:

Only code taken from online:
https://www.baeldung.com/convert-string-to-input-stream
I used this to figure out how to convert a string to an
input stream as I knew how to convert existing streams
into each other but had never converted a string into an
input stream
